So when i originally started to get into the tech. world i was in high school when i started to understand how fast technology was advancing. So i decided to take some computer classes to peak my interest and see if it was something that was for me or it was just something that would turn into a job that i would hate to wake up everyday and go too.
As i went through those classes i realized i wanted to take a deaper dive into this technology thing and learn what possiblities there would be for me. 

The more i was interested in this field, i chose to read articles online of what kinds of things i could try to see what would peak my interest in and allow to focus more time onto. Going through many articles on the internet i discovered that they had these test i can take that would lead you towards a group of jobs to choose from that best suits me. i then realized after taking this test that i was a person that enjoyed to have a challenge and loved to face problems that i had to take and solve the issue myself or with a group of people to work as a unit.

When i found out that software engineering was one of the top 3 options at the end of the test i took, i chose to get into a more advanced class in highschool that dealt with working with coding, motherboardes, and abit of robotics. At this point i knew i found something that i really enjoyed doing but i was lost at that time and didnt know where to begin. So for the next several years i decided that getting a job as quick as possible was more important than investing in myself and getting my education. I worked as a mechanic for many years and as much as that tickled my fancy by allowing me to build my mechanical and problem solving skills, i learned that the job just wouldnt be somehthing i could see myself doing forever. While i was doing that job i constantly queastioned if i would be able to learn how to code and i was built for it. So i never attempted to do it, but now that i have learned new ways to learn and problem solve and i realized that what i am doing now for a job is not making me happy i decided it was time to push out of my comfort zone and do what i truly wanted to do from the beginning. Now i am here with flatiron school trying my best to learn all that i can learn and become a software engineer that i inspired to do many years ago.
